# 💰 Personal Budget App

## Overview
Personal Budget App is a personal finance application designed to solve a common problem:  
individuals struggle to track their income and expenses and often cannot clearly understand where their money goes by the end of the month.

The goal of this project is not only expense tracking, but also helping users build **financial awareness** through simple and meaningful insights.

---

## Problem Statement
Many users:
- Track expenses inconsistently
- Cannot analyze spending by category
- Lose control of their budget at the end of the month

Manual tools such as Excel sheets or notes are not sustainable and often lead users to abandon tracking entirely.

---

## Solution Approach
This project focuses on a **clean and frictionless user experience** by providing:

- Quick income and expense input
- Category-based expense grouping
- Real-time visibility of overall budget status

The project was intentionally built using an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** mindset to validate the core problem before adding complexity.

## User Flow
1. User adds an income or expense  
2. Each transaction is assigned to a category  
3. The application updates total balance and category distribution  
4. The user gains clear visibility into spending habits  

This flow prioritizes **clarity over complexity**, avoiding overwhelming reports and focusing on actionable insights.

## Key Decisions & Trade-offs
- **Frontend-first architecture was chosen**  
  → To shorten development time and validate the product idea quickly.

- **Advanced charts and reports were intentionally excluded**  
  → To keep the experience simple and focused on the core budgeting problem.

This project was built as a **problem-solving product**, not a feature showcase.

- Identify real user problems
- Translate business needs into a technical solution
- Make conscious trade-offs between speed, usability, and scalability
